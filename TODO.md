# TODO
  - Optimize object graph.
    - Repliace collections of one constraint with that constraint
    - not sure that this situation would ever occur, save for poorly formed schemas
  - Cache compiled object graphs as serialized to files/memcache
  - Investigate compiling the object graph into procedural PHP code
  - Implement "unique" constraints, eg uniqueItems, enum, etc.
  - Implement Schema Resolver
  - Implement dot/slash delimited fragement resolution
  - Implement $ref/$schema attributes
  - Figure out how to fill in default attributes
